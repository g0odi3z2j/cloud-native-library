title: Install with tctl
---

Documents in this section will guide you through how to Install TSB using tctl.

TSB can be installed on your on-premise or cloud servers, giving you full control
on how TSB Management Plane is configured and installed. You will also be able to
try out our [demo installation](./demo-installation).

You will still have to read up on subjects covered in the 
[Installation & Upgrade](./../), such as [downloading tctl](./../requirements-and-download),
[how to connect to TSB with tctl](./../tctl_connect), etc.
